# WORD DECODER USING BEAM SEARCH

## Todo
- [X] Alias name for pattern (Maybe latter)
- [X] Setup material for punish function (how much point to punish)
- [X] Implement punish function 
- [X] Implement function to get MxN matrix
- [ ] Construct dictionary
- [X] Implement beamsearch
- [ ] Implement beamsearch with CTC decodE
- [X] Magic to get better point

## Summarize:
- Pattern : Alias with A,B,C
- Direction: UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT, FORWARD,
- Location: HEAD, MOUTH, SHOULDER, CHEST, BELLY

chụm -> A
xòe  -> B
chụm_trỏ -> C
duỗi ->   D
duỗi_cái -> E

- Problem with direction, cannot tracking hand is in state upside or downside
- Some word will be need determine is upside or downside to get correct result. Example: Thanks you => pattern B, but cannot track upside or downside
👉 Solution Suggest: 
1. Determine which left hand or right hand
2. Calculate (1,17) which negative is upside and vice versa, correctponding to left hand

Example: **Cảm ơn** -> [(A,MOUTH,_),(B,CHEST,FORWARD)]

**QUEUE INPUT** 👉 [(A,MOUTH,_),(A,CHEST,UP),(B,CHEST,FORWARD),(_,CHEST,_),(_,_,_)]
**ALGORITHM**
- LOOP QUEUE AS ITEM
- ROW = PUNISH(ITEM)
- MATRIX PUSH ROW

**OUTPUT** 👉 INPUT MATRIX TO BEAM_SEARCH
- OUTPUT EXPECTED >> [(A,MOUTH,_),_,(B,CHEST,FORWARD),_,_]
- MODULE DECODE OUTPUT >> WORD

```
  Hand State Example:
    { 
      PATTERN: (_,A),
      LOCATION: (_,MOUTH),
      DIRECTION: (_,_) 
    },
    { 
      PATTERN: (_,B),
      LOCATION: (_,CHEST),
      DIRECTION: (_,FORWARD) 
    }
    { 
      PATTERN: (_,C),
      LOCATION: (_,CHEST),
      DIRECTION: (_,BACKWARD) 
    }
    { 
      PATTERN: (_,C),
      LOCATION: (_,CHEST),
      DIRECTION: (_,FORWARD) 
    }
    {
      PATTERN: (A,D),
      LOCATION: (CHEST,CHEST),
      DIRECTION: (DOWN,LEFT)
    }
```
